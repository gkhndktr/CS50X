## CS50'S Introduction To Computer Science

I have successfully completed CS50x, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.

Course Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development.
Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML.
Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming.
